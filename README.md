# Assignment: One HTML and CSS

For this assignment, you will clone Dr. John Monberg's wra410 repository.

You will update your README.md file so that I can learn about the changes you made.

If I can't find your changes, I can't give you credit for them

Revise the following section in your README.md file with a short description of what you've accomplished.

## Required Changes to WRA 410

1. Make changes to the background color of a page and a div.

2. Use a new font. I used a MSU color hex for the green. I had it as a neon color at first.

3. Include two images. I used the same two images but for different pages. I put them above the header instead of below.

4. Use a table to format the Grading Scale on the Assignments page. I used a table but It didnt come out right.
its set up without a grid around it or between. 

5. Reformat the Student Groups. Use a different color for links, add a title for each group, seperate each student. Use multiple columns for the divs.  I couldnt do this.

6. Add navigation to the Schedule webpage. I took the navigation from the index page and implemented it. 

7. Revise the rows and columns on the Schedule webpage so the information is clearer or prettier. I changed the grid-coloumn pixels so that the words were clearer and fitted within its coloumn. I included a header div because there wasn't one like the others.
